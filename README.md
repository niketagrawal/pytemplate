## Pytemplate

A template for structuring a Python project. 

## Usage

- Create the repository for your project using this template by clicking on the `Use this template` button on this repository. Provide a desired name for your new repository while performing this action. This will create a new repository in your github account with the same contents as this repository. You can read more about GitHub's generate a repository from template feature [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

- After the new repository is created in your GitHub account, rename the root directory `project` with your project title and edit the README.md
